Making a CPP release
 : building and relesing library
 : working with that library in different project
	: setting paths 
	: putting the dll file in the right catalog in release
: making it into git and providing version control - so things like downloading a .dll file from git repo as i create a new project.


Lib Idea
 "Matthew Strumi³³o Types"
 : createion and use of these:
	mst.hpp
	mst.lib
	mst.dll
 : The library contains
	my defined types
	bool64 API
	other (like forever keyword)
